    items:
      - "16-bit physics that provides a real retro feel."
      - "Lords of Exile is not another Metroidvania, it is a true tribute to the most respected classic games of the late 80s and early 90s!."
      - "The linear level design created in the old-fashioned way, the behavior of the enemies and the elaborated bosses driven by patterns will once again revive the golden age of the video game."
      - "The game feel, the arcade gameplay or the care and detailed 8-bit pixel art with Japanese anime style are undoubtedly some of the reasons that have made Lords of Exile stand out from a large number of games since the first moment it was showed to the world through of Twitter."
      - "The epic 16-bit OST created with the Megadrive sound chip and anime touches will remind the great Japanese action games of the console."

    items:
      - "Range the 8 full of action and dangers levels in a perfect classic linear design and defeat the powerful end-of-zone bosses."
      - "Powerful throwing weapons and melee combat, jump and vertical attack, climb through some areas, dashing to dodge the enemy attacks or collect valuable items in the purest arcade style are some of the Gabriel abilities."
      - "Use the 3 powers of the shadows to get their advantages and go forward on your way among the evil creatures to be able to overcome each level."
      - "A lot of more cool things!"
reviews:
  - content: "But while Metroidvania games are always welcome, we are admittedly lacking in games that resemble the more traditional, NES-era Castlevania games. So this right here is certainly a welcome sight, nailing down the graphics quite well while appearing to set up some satisfying boss battles. Can’t wait for the Kickstarter campaign!"

  - content: "It looks to be loaded with classic Konami Castlevania vibes in the best way, feeling like a natural continuation of what *[Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon](https://www.nintendoenthusiast.com/bloodstained-curse-of-the-moon-limited-run-games/)* began."

  - content: "Lords of exile is a love letter to a whole generation of 8-bit games and drink of great game classics like Castlevania, Ghost & Goblins or Black tiger. His retro aesthetic with a (very intentional) very limited palette is not an impediment to show off very expressive sprites and careful animations that fill us with tender nostalgia to those of us who are of a certain age and will surprise those younger ones with their liveliness."

## Supported platforms

The official platforms are Steam (PC and MAC) and Nintendo SWITCH, the game is programmed and designed to be easily ported to XBOX ONE and PS4. There are plans to do this but it is still pending negotiation, for this reason, it is not yet official.

## Languages

The supported languages are:

- English (UK)
- Italian
- Spanish (Spain)
- French
- German

## Music

The Lords of Exile OST will be compounded with a faithful mix of old sound chip emulations contained in several of the mythical '90s consoles but also some guitars or old synthesizers, resulting in as you can listen in the trailer archetype track, a crunchy, catchy, and energetic 8-bit on steroids OST.

**Dominic Ninmark** (composer of Blazing Chrome, Rival Megagun...) and **Pentadrangle** (composer of Roof Rage, Cyber Shadow...) will collaborate in the OST and they take the musical direction of the game

## Sound effects

The game 8-bit SFXs are created in an hybrid way between sounds, beeps, and noises extracted from classic consoles Sound Chips emulations and conventional Sound Design techniques used in the AAA game industry.

## History

**Lords of Exile** was born in 2018 in Carlos Zazuaga's room as a small experiment out of curiosity to test out the pixel-perfect rendering capabilities and the 2D shaders of Godot Engine.

As time went by, the game became more and more popular and the project grew and progressed more and more until what it is today.

Due to the need for flexibility in console ports, the project has been migrated off the engine and now runs on **Game Maker Studio 2**.

## Special thanks

The entire project was funded by an awesome community of gamers in the **KickStarter** platform, raising a total of more than ***31000 €***, representing the 258% (!!) of the initial goal of ***12000 €***. Thanks to this, the game will exceed by far the expectations and will be launched very soon through 2021.

Indie game development is tough at the beginning, mostly because of the shortage of money, but the community backing us is the best. Your support will be always welcome and we will always thank you. The [KickStarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/czazuaga/lords-of-exile/) is over, but you can still contribute to the development through Paypal. Please feel free to contact us if you want to contribute in some form to our email: squidbit@gmail.com
